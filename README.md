## Overview
This project implements basic image classification using TensorFlow. We utilize a neural network to classify images from the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The primary focus is on understanding and applying key concepts such as neural networks, one hot encoding, dense layers, and more using the TensorFlow framework.

## Terminology
- **Keras**: A high-level API for neural networks which can run with TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano as its backend.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source platform and framework for creating, training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models.
- **Neural Network**: A computing system that works as a universal function approximator by learning correlations between given input and output data.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library for the Python programming language.
- **One Hot Encoding**: Encoding used for representation of categorical output labels where a valid label has a single high score in a group of classes, and all other classes have low scores.
- **Vector**: An object with a magnitude and a direction in a multi-dimensional space.
- **Dense Laye**r: A neural network layer in which all the nodes are connected to all the nodes of the preceding layer.
- **Activation Function**: Typically a non-linear function that serves output for various nodes in neural networks.
- **Loss Function**: A function that computes a measure of difference between a model's predicted values and the true labels given in a dataset.
- **Optimizer**: An algorithm that aims to minimize the output of a loss function by updating parameters of a model being trained.

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib
- Keras
- numpy

## Getting Started
1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   [Link to Colab Notebook]([https://colab.research.google.com/your-notebook-link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Abdelmalek-Djemaa/Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow/blob/main/Basic_Image_Classification_with_TensorFlow.ipynb))

2. Ensure you have the required dataset. The MNIST dataset is typically loaded directly within the notebook using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Usage
1. Prepare Data:
   - The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded and prepared when running the notebook.
   
2. Run the Notebook:
   - Open and run the cells in the Colab notebook. The notebook will:
     - Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
     - Build and train a neural network model
     - Evaluate the model
     - Generate predictions and visualizations

## Results
- Discuss the performance metrics and insights gained from evaluating the model.
- Include visualizations of sample predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Potential enhancements or modifications to improve model accuracy or efficiency.
- Ideas for expanding the project scope or applying the model to other datasets.
